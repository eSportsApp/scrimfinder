<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Scrimfinder Network is a Scrimsearch network currently only for Rainbow Six Siege. You can add any client you want to the Network and send and recieve Scrimsearches. The Network is moderated wich means, that banned users are not able to search for Scrims. The bannes are made by the Rainbow Class System.
The Idea behind the Network is, to add an easy and reliable way to find Scrims to the Rainbow Six Siege competetive Scene. We are Aiming forward to launch the eSportsApp soon and offer a seemless integration into it.

## Getting Started

To get Started, we suggest our Article in our Documentation. The easiest way to start is to just clone our Bot repo

### Prerequisites

This Package is requierd for all builds you do with the Network. 
  ```sh
  npm install @esportsapp/client@latest

You also need an API key wich you have to set into your env as
